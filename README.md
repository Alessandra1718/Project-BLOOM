# Project BLOOM
This is our STEM Senior Engineering year-long Capstone Project. We aim to create an automated watering system for houseplants, powered by an Arduino Uno Rev3. Any code for this project will be periodically uploaded, depending on how far we make it. 
Our last presentaiton day will be soon, with some updates on this project to follow and a conclusion to the year-long capstone project. 

I am working with three other teamates however most work will be uploaded here (by me) as many are not familiar with github. 
StellaL25 is now a contributor on this project - one of my teamates :D 
Most of the code will be written in replit, Arduino IDE or an arduino online simulator such as Wokwi or TinkerCad, updated weekly
