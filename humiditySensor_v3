/*Here are the connections
temp avg - 22 C
hum avg - 44 or 43 %
squeezing it with your hand for a few cycels of measurments will bring up the humidity rapidly to 95%, while the temp will take a while to change but 
will go over 26 and will reach the " water here now" if else loop 
check serial export 9 csv to check the data for this one
