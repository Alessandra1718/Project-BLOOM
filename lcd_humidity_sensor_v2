/*Here are the connections
22      
23      Take a DHT11 sensor.
24      there, in the DHT11 sensor, there  are 3 or 4 pins.
25      There, on the DHT11 sensor, there is writen S, +, -
26      connect "S" on the digital pin 7.
27      connect "+" on the 5V pin on  Arduino.
28      connect "-" on the GND pin on Arduino.
